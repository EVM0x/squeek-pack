/* HOLDER SHIFT, the part of Squeek Pack that a Squeekchain profile opens.

   Three rules shape this file.

   One: the arcade is free for everybody. Nobody is ever asked for a wallet to
   play, and no shift is locked behind a token. What a profile gets is one burst
   of sight: the chute shows the next burst before it arrives, so the player can
   decide whether the room they have left is worth spending. It is not a
   multiplier and it does not touch the score, because nothing in the whitepaper
   makes a Squeek worth more work than another.

   Two: it is not only Squeeks. Squeekchain hands out holder badges for twenty
   other collections (Punks, Apes, Milady, IMD, Normies, Yield Fields and the
   rest) and builder badges for the CODE lane, and a tier that only counted
   Squeeks would be ignoring most of what a profile actually is. So the weight
   is everything a profile carries: Squeeks in the wallet, Squeeks staked
   (counted twice), every holder badge, every builder badge, and a trophy for
   the few that are one of one.

   Three: the lookup is read-only and unsigned, so it cannot prove the wallet
   belongs to the person at the keyboard. That is deliberate. Claiming a tier
   you do not hold buys one preview of a burst you were about to be shown
   anyway, so there is nothing to gain by lying. For the same reason the card says
   "TIER" rather than "HOLDER": it reports which tier the run was played on,
   and nothing about who owns what.

   The badge half cannot be read from the browser directly, because
   community.squeekchain.com only sends CORS headers to squeekchain.com. api.php
   in this same folder is the read-only proxy that fetches it server-side. If
   that file is missing, the lookup says so instead of pretending.

   Nothing here signs, spends, or stores a key. */
