/* SQUEEK PACK, the packing rules.

   Everything in this file is arithmetic from the Squeekchain whitepaper and
   nothing else. No DOM, no network, no clock: a shift is a pure function of a
   seed, a starting difficulty and the choices a player makes. That is on
   purpose, because the rules have to be testable without a browser.

   The four rules this game is built on, quoted from the paper:

     "Work is grouped into rounds of exactly 600 seconds, ten minutes... A round
      can hold at most 10,000 work units, which is exactly as many as the 60 ms
      spacing allows in ten minutes. The cap is a safety limit: a passage beyond
      it would be rejected."

     "it never moves work from one round to another"

     "every billion block units completes one Squeek block"

     blockUnits += floor(w x 10^12 / D)
     D_next      = floor((29 x D + floor(w x 1,000 / 40)) / 30)   when w >= 40
     D_next      = D                                              when w <  40

   So: a round is a bin of 10,000. The bursts he runs have to go in it or be
   lost, because work never moves between rounds. What lands in the bin is
   priced at the difficulty earlier rounds set, and difficulty is a ratchet: a
   heavy round makes every later round worth less per work unit. */
